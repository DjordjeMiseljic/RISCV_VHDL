-Check if forwarding unit forward correclty in case of rd_mem = rd_wb = rs1. DONE
-Check if stall is maximum 2 clk long. DONE
-Check if R-type instruction in ex phase causes only one clk stall. DONE
-Check if pc always increments by four, when instructions are not of branch type. DONE



-Check if JAL is in ID and JALR is in EXE, will JAL be flushed. in process DONE


-Check if there is a flush when JAL, JALR instructions appear. TODO
-Check if branch condition is asserted when R-type instruction is in ID phase. TODO 
-check if there is an error if two branch instruction come one after another. TODO
-Figure out how to check if processors halts. TODO


-Check mem_to_reg after 3 clk when certain instructions appear in ID phase
-check mem_to_reg when
-check if forwarding is done right, meaning see if the result at alu inputs are the same as the result in the next stage. The same thing needs to be done for branch_condition generator.
-Assert that a sequence BEQ, R, R, will not change the state of registers because R instruction will be flushed.


--Check if All instructions that need to flush flush.

TODO list

- Nece zaputacit procesor
- Pokusaj da assumujes stall i flush DONE
- Kada ostavim assume za ispravne instrukcije proveri da li ce zapucati na los assert DONE
- Proveri nexttime reg_write_wb DONE
