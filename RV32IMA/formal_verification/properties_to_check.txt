-Check if forwarding unit forward correclty in case of rd_mem = rd_wb = rs1. 
-Check if stall is maximum 2 clk long.
-Check if R-type instruction in ex phase causes only one clk stall
-Check if pc always increments by four, when instructions are not of branch type.
##1 always (past(pc) == PC-4)

-Check if there is a flush when JAL, JALR instructions appear
-Check if JAL is is ID and JALR is in EXE, will JAL be flushed
-Check if branch condition is asserted when R-type instruction is in ID phase
-check if there is an error if two branch instruction come one after another
-Figure out how to check if processors halts
-check if more than one clk flush can appear
