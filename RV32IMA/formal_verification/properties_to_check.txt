-Check if R-type instruction in ex phase causes only one clk stall. DONE
-Check if pc always increments by four, when instructions are not of branch type. DONE


-Check if there is a flush when JAL, JALR instructions appear. TODO
-Check if JAL is is ID and JALR is in EXE, will JAL be flushed. TODO
-Check if branch condition is asserted when R-type instruction is in ID phase. TODO 
-check if there is an error if two branch instruction come one after another. TODO
-Figure out how to check if processors halts. TODO
-check if more than one clk flush can appear. TODO
