BUG1:In forwarding unit add a0, a0, a0 would't work because if elseif was used instead of two separete ifs
BUG2:LUI or AUIPC or JAL in ID phase and LOAD in EX phase cause an unnecesary stall. DONE

BUG3: LOAD doesnt cause a stall when JALR is in id stage and LOAD is in EX phase. DONE

BUG4: in hazard unit when BRANCH_id = 00 rs2 = rd should be checked, but only for some instructions, not for all, because
      there is no point to stall when I instructions appear beacuse they do not use rs2 register. DONE


BUG5: load in EX and JALR in ID should cause only one clk stall, not two . DONE
